# Image Format Converter
This script converts images from one format to another. It takes a source folder, a new folder, and the desired image format as command line arguments.
	 
Requirements
Python 3.x
Pillow library (pip install Pillow)
Usage
Save the script to a file (e.g. convert.py).
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script using the following command: python convert.py <source_folder> <new_folder> <image_format>
<source_folder>: The path to the folder containing the images you want to convert.
<new_folder>: The path to the folder where you want to save the converted images. If this folder doesnâ€™t exist, it will be created automatically.
<image_format>: The desired image format (e.g. png, jpg, etc.).
Example:

python convert.py C:\Users\John\Pictures C:\Users\John\Converted png
This command will convert all images in the C:\Users\John\Pictures folder to PNG format and save them in the C:\Users\John\Converted folder.
